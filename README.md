## Code Structure

The codebase for the Assignment 3 Mainpage project is structured as follows:



Assignment3_Mainpage
   Assingment3.css
   Assingment3.js
   index.html
   README.txt





Assignment3.css: This is a CSS file that contains the style to the layout, color schemes, and responsible features of the webpage. JavaScript logic for toggling the form, validation of the form, navigation on smooth scrolling, and changing the color of the background is contained in yet another JavaScript file, `Assignment3.js`.

The main web page should be `index.html`, hosting the content structure with markup for every other section like "About Me," "Services," "Contact," etc. Last but not least is `README.txt`, a complete document on the structure, functionality, dependencies, and assets used in the project.






## Functions Documentation ### Form Toggling

The function `toggling form` allows users to dynamically switch the form requests. This is facilitated through the JavaScript function `togggleForm(formId)` that enhances the user interface towards a flexible, smooth user experience, and great user control.





### Form Validation

The form validation is important so that the correctness and completion of the data can be ascertained before submission. The JavaScript function `formValidation(formId)` validates all the form entry fields: first name, last name, email, description, and date.

The data integrity is conserved in conjunction with user interaction through required fields and invalid entries with the aid of error messages.





### Navbar Navigation

The navbar navigation feature navigates via smooth scroll navigation between different sections on the webpage. You can use the JavaScript event listeners on the links of the navigation bar. Therefore, while scrolling, they ought to be About Me, Services, and Contact, guaranteeing that the content is accessible and discoverable.









## Asset List

No external asset has been used in the development of this project. All icons, images, and fonts are created in-house or may be filled with software.






## File Structure

All these files directly lie in the root directory of the project, and they ensure that the file structure is kept clean and organized. All these, therefore, lead to easier navigation and maintaining of the codebase; hence, development and collaboration are simple. ## Reused Code All the work developed in this project is new; there is no reuse of code from any of the previous assignments (A1 or A2). The new code has been specifically developed from scratch, in order to meet the requirements and objectives of assignment 3. ## References No such external references or resources have been used while making this project. All the codes, design components, and functionalities have been ideated and implemented on their own, taking into consideration the guidelines and goals required for the project.
